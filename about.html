      I'm Tayyaba Iftikhar, a passionate web programmer and designer. I specialize in building beautiful, functional websites that create meaningful digital experiences.
      With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Git, GitHub, Communication, and Maple, I bring a dynamic approach to development and design.
      <br><br>
      My journey in web development started from curiosity, and today it has turned into a full-fledged skillset capable of delivering high-end web applications.
      My HTML & CSS skills allow me to craft pixel-perfect layouts, while JavaScript brings my designs to life with interactivity.
      <br><br>
      Python is my go-to language for logic and backend scripting, and I maintain code effectively using Git & GitHub. Communication is one of my strongest soft skills that enables me to understand client needs and translate them into functional products.
      <br><br>
      Maple, being a mathematical software, has given me insights into logical structuring and algorithmic approaches, enhancing my problem-solving capabilities.
      <br><br>
      My work reflects creativity, attention to detail, and dedication. Whether it’s a portfolio, business website, or an interactive web platform — I can deliver high-quality results.
      I aim to not only build websites but to build trust and long-term relationships with clients.
      <br><br>
      I keep myself updated with modern design trends and frameworks. I’m always learning and pushing my limits to offer better solutions. My professionalism, teamwork spirit, and ability to handle pressure make me an ideal candidate for any web project.
